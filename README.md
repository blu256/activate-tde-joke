# Your Trinity Desktop is Not Activated"
Activation watermark simulator for the Trinity desktop.

Released into Public Domain.

Inspired by the "Activate your Linux" watermark.

## Why?
This is meant to be a joke, please do not use it in any serious manner whatsoever.

Also this shows the flexibility of many Trinity components, in this case the desktop and Superkaramba, which can be scripted with dcop and simple shell scripts.

## How?

This script installs a custom SuperKaramba theme and applies some special settings to your desktop configuration and comes with the restore functionality.

That should not mess up your previous desktop setup unless you do some changes to the configuration while in "watermark mode", in which case you will lose any changes made in that mode and which is not recommended anyway.

## Can I trust it?

You can inspect the way this script works to see that nothing nefarious takes place behind the scenes.

To be on the safe side, back up your `kdesktoprc` configuration file, located in your user config directory (usually `~/.trinity/share/config`).
